# Biomedical Named Entity Recognition (NER) Project

This project aims to extract important entities, such as diseases, drugs, and their dosages, from biomedical text data using natural language processing (NLP) techniques.

# Purpose:

The primary goal of this project is to assist in analyzing clinical text data to extract relevant biomedical entities, which can be crucial for various biomedical applications such as information extraction, text classification, and question-answering systems.

# Components:

Installation: The project requires the installation of spaCy and scispaCy libraries along with specific pre-trained models for biomedical NER.

Usage: Once the libraries and models are installed, the provided Python code demonstrates how to load the models, process clinical text data, and extract entities such as diseases, drugs, and their dosages using pattern matching techniques.

Output: The output includes visualizations of entity recognition results, printed information about extracted entities, and pattern matching results, which can be saved in a CSV file for further analysis or model training.

# Potential Applications:

Disease detection

Predictive analysis

Clinical decision support systems

Medical text classification

Summarization

Question-answering systems
